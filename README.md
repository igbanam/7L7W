Seven Languages in Seven Weeks [#7L7W](https://twitter.com/search?q=%237L7W)
===

This is a self-enhancement project aimed at learning seven new languages in seven weeks. I should thank [Aimee Rivers](https://github.com/sermoa) for her blog post which I stumbled upon to start this project.

Languages
---
My new seven programming languages differ from those chosen by the good folks at Pragmatic Programming (see DIsclaimer).

+ [Prolog](https://github.com/languages/Prolog)
+ [Io](https://github.com/languages/Io)
+ [Erlang](https://github.com/languages/Erlang)
+ [Elixir](https://github.com/languages/Elixir)
+ [Clojure](https://github.com/languages/Clojure)
+ [Haskell](https://github.com/languages/Haskell)
+ [Mercury](https://github.com/languages/Mercury)

Resources
---
+ Prolog:
  + [Learn Prolog Now](http://learnprolognow.org) by [Patrick Blackburn](http://www.loria.fr/~blackbur/), [Johan Bos](http://www.let.rug.nl/bos/) and [Kristina Stiegnitz](http://cs.union.edu/~striegnk/)
  + [Prolog Tutorial](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~liberti/public/computing/prog/prolog/prolog-tutorial.html)
  + Guide to Prolog Programming by Roman Barták. Both the [old](http://kti.ms.mff.cuni.cz/~bartak/prolog.old/learning/) and the [new](http://kti.ms.mff.cuni.cz/~bartak/prolog/contents.html).
  + [Prolog Tutorial](http://www.csupomona.edu/~jrfisher/www/prolog_tutorial/contents.html) by J. R. Fisher
  + [Adventure in Prolog](http://www.amzi.com/AdventureInProlog/advtop.php)
  + [Prolog Programming, A First Course](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/pbrna/prologbook/)  
  Some other advanced sources are 
  + [Expert Systems in Prolog](http://www.amzi.com/ExpertSystemsInProlog/)
  + [Prolog for Software Engineering](http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~j-hamer/07.363/prolog-for-se.html) by Peter B. Reintjes
  + J-Paine's [Public Prolog Library](http://www.j-paine.org/prolog/library.html) and
  + [Artificial Intelligence through Prolog](http://faculty.nps.edu/ncrowe/book/book.html) by Neil C. Rowe

Inasmuch as this is on Github, the leading website for code collaboration and sharing, I recommend you do not fork this repository to work off from; but start your own project. Choose languages which interest you, find resources to learn them and log your progress. I would suggest—if you are on this learning path—that you log your progress on Twitter using [#7L7W](https://twitter.com/search?q=%237L7W). This way we can encourage one another.

Disclaimer

This is not my brain-child. The concept was originally coined by the [Pragmatic Programmers](http://pragprog.com). They released a book; rightly named "Seven Languages in Seven Weeks" which taught the following languages:

+ Ruby
+ Io
+ Prolog
+ Scala
+ Erlang
+ Clojure
+ Haskell

I advice you to grab [a copy of the book](http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks).
