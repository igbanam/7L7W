Elixir
===

Created by @josevalim, Elixir is a functional programming language which looks like the love child of Erlang and Ruby. Although I have not read anything to this effect, the [nine minute screencast]() by []() makes me think so. If this is not the case—if Erlang is NOT the father and Ruby is NOT the mother—whatever… this paragraph stays anyway.

Elixir is not originally part of the Seven Languages in Seven Weeks presented by Pragmatic Programmers, @pragdave can confirm. But I thought it to be an interesting language to learn, nonetheless.
